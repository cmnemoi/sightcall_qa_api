- Use `async` for non-blocking operations
- Define endpoints with `@app.get`, `@app.post`, etc.
- Use `pydantic` for request validation
- Handle errors with `HTTPException`
- Document APIs with `OpenAPI`
- Use dependency injection for shared logic
- Organize code by feature
- Use routers for modular endpoints
- Validate data with `pydantic` models
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
